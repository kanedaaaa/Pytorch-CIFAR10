# pytorch-cifar10
Image classification models on CIFAR10 dataset using pytorch

*After some tweaking on LeNet5, got low accuracy, about 65% on 10000 images (i think there was about 62k params), i guess it's because model was trained on Nvidia GeForce 920mx (2gb) which is not strong enough. Anyways, i will try to change some hyperparameters to achieve maximum and probably will test this on much stronger gpu later.*
